The following are a set of multiple types of artifacts published to Connect.  They share or build on the same base analysis.  Their purpose is to demonstrate how each type of asset can showcase an aspect of the analysis. The idea is to enable you to reach your audiences more effectively and efficiently.  

**Background:** This project combines US CENSUS population data with hospital data provided by Medicare.  A linear model is used to determine if a county is over or under served.The *source code* and data for all of the assets can be found in our [Access to Care]( https://github.com/sol-eng/access-to-care/) GitHub repo.
