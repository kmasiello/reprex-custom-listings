This app provides real-time predictions of the number of bikes that will be available at the stations of Washington DC's docked bike share, Capital Bikeshare. Creating and visualizing those predictions takes advantage of many different types of R content and the ability to deploy them on Connect.

## Background

Like many metropolitan areas, the Washington DC area has bicycles available for short-term rental to commuters and tourists at docks around the city. The number of bikes at each of these docks ebbs and flows throughout the day, and the Capital Bikeshare program provides real-time data on the number of bikes available at each dock via [an API](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
